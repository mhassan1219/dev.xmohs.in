# macOS Setup with a Bash Script

Setting up a new macOS machine can be both fun and cumbersome. It usually involves a combination of installations, configurations, and fine-tunings that can consume hours of your time. In this blog post, I'll introduce you to a handy Bash script that will do most of the heavy lifting for you. From installing essential Homebrew packages to setting up developer tools and productivity apps, this script will have you up and running in no time.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure:

1. You are **not** running the script as a root user.
2. You have an internet connection for downloading packages and apps.

## How to Use the Script

1. Save the provided Bash script to a file, e.g., `setup_uv.sh`.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder containing `setup_uv.sh`.
4. Make the script executable with `chmod +x setup_uv.sh`.
5. Run the script using `./setup_uv.sh`.

## What Does the Script Do?

Here is a brief overview of what the script installs or configures:

### System and Developer Tools:

- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Essential tools for compiling and debugging from the terminal.
- **Homebrew**: The package manager for macOS (or Linux).
- **Zsh Completions**: Adds additional completion definitions for Zsh.
- **ssh-copy-id**: A script that installs an SSH key on a server as an authorized key.
- **wget**: A free utility for non-interactive downloading of files from the web.
- **git**: Distributed version control system.
- **uv**: A fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.
- **openssl, readline, sqlite3, xz, zlib**: Libraries needed for various packages.
- **syncthing**: Open-source continuous file synchronization program.

### Apps:

- **Tabby, Fig, Visual Studio Code, Docker**: Developer tools.
- **1Password, Shadow**: Security apps.
- **Superhuman, Slack, Keybase**: Communication apps.
- **VMware Fusion**: Virtualization software.
- **Obsidian, HiddenBar, Numi, Arc, Charles, Itsycal**: Productivity apps.
- **Raycast, Insomnia**: API and shell utilities.
- **AltServer**: Alternative app store for non-jailbroken iOS devices.
- **Adobe Creative Cloud, Elgato Stream Deck**: Creative and streaming apps.

### Other Configurations:

- Makes the `~/Library` folder visible.
- Installs the latest Python version using `uv`.
- Upgrades `pip` and `setuptools`.
- Installs `virtualenv` for Python.
- Sets up directories and configurations for `pip`.
- Installs `Oh My Zsh` for a better shell experience.
- Adds a global `pip` function (`gpip`) to your Zsh configuration.

### Error Logging:

The script captures all output and timestamps it, storing this information in a `setup_uv.log` file. This can be invaluable for debugging or understanding what the script has done.

## Noteworthy Points

- The script checks if an application or package is already installed before attempting installation.
- The script does not run as a root user. It exits if attempted.
- Some apps like `Syncthing`, `Superhuman`, `ChatGPT`, and `Rocket Pro` may require post-installation setup. You will see a message in the terminal reminding you of this.
- Remember to look at the `setup_uv.log` file for any post-installation tasks.

## Conclusion

Automating your macOS setup can save you hours of manual work, leaving you with a ready-to-use machine stocked with essential tools and apps. You can further customize this script according to your personal needs, making your next macOS setup a breeze.
