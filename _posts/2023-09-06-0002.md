Setting Up A Python Development Environment - September 6, 2023
===============================================================

Setting up a proper development environment is crucial for productive software development. This blog post guides you through setting up a Python development environment on macOS, using tools like Homebrew, uv, Zsh, Virtualenv, and Pip.

Installing uv via Homebrew
----------------------------

First, we will install uv and some essential libraries via Homebrew. Open your terminal and run:



```bash
brew install uv openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```

Setting Up Zsh
--------------

Next, add uv's bin directory to your Zsh configuration:



```bash
echo -e "\n# Add uv to PATH\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.uv/bin:$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Installing Python Using uv
----------------------------

To manage multiple Python versions easily, we'll use uv. Install the latest version of Python as follows:



```bash
uv python install
python --version
```

Upgrading Pip and Setuptools
----------------------------

Before proceeding, ensure that you are using the latest versions of Pip and Setuptools:



```bash
uv pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Setting Up Virtualenv
---------------------

Virtual environments are essential for isolating project dependencies. To install Virtualenv, run:



```bash
uv pip install virtualenv
```

Directory Setup
---------------

Now let's create some directories to organize our projects, virtual environments, and Pip configuration files:



```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects ~/Virtualenvs ~/.config/pip
```

Configuring Pip
---------------

Edit the Pip configuration file to require a virtual environment for installations:



```bash
vim ~/.config/pip/pip.conf
```

Add the following lines:



```conf
[install]
require-virtualenv = true

[uninstall]
require-virtualenv = true
```

Modifying Zsh Configuration
---------------------------

Add the following function to your `~/.zshrc` file to allow global Pip installations:



```bash
gpip(){
   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="0" python -m pip "$@"
}
```

Testing Your Setup
------------------

Finally, test your setup:



```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv  # This shouldn't work
```

To perform global installations:



```bash
gpip install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv  # This should work
```

That's it! You now have a functional Python development environment set up on your macOS system. Feel free to adjust the settings to suit your personal workflow. Happy coding!
